Hi guys, my name is Dmitri.

2
00:00:02,725 --> 00:00:04,871
I'm an artist, designer, developer...

3
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,352
...and the creator of Analog.Cafe:

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,759
"The REMARKABLE Photo Blog."

5
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:12,321
So, what is Analog.Cafe?

6
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:14,413
...and why is it REMARKABLE?

7
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:17,765
Well, to put it simply it is a curated community blog...

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,835
...that lets anyone who's into FILM PHOTOGRAPHY...

9
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:24,152
...to effortlessly contribute and collaborate.

10
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:27,789
What I'm trying to do here is to create a PUBLICATION that makes...

11
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:30,609
...working together a natural process.

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,723
Even for introverts.

13
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:36,497
Let's say Cara submits a photograph of a train in Sri Lanka.

14
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:39,731
And it gets featured on Analog.Cafe.

15
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:42,179
A lot of people get to enjoy her work.

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,030
Now, imagine Finn,

17
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:48,444
who is working on a photo essay about trains around the world.

18
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:53,529
He can use Cara's image from the "Features" library...

19
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:57,159
...to supplement his photographs.

20
00:00:57,575 --> 00:00:59,575
Finn gets to extend his vision.

21
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:02,189
Cara gets full credit.

22
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:04,245
Automatically.

23
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:07,465
So, here's how it's going to work:

24
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:10,198
I've already coded and designed the interface...

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,200
...of the website.

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,510
The same design is going to be used for the Zine - your reward.

27
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:22,019
A physical extension of Analog.Cafe.

28
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:27,881
A lot of the technical details concerning making the website...

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
...are being worked on right now.

30
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:32,454
Your contribution will help me pay...

31
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:34,456
...for talented developers...

32
00:01:34,456 --> 00:01:37,069
...to connect the interface of the website...

33
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:39,094
...to a database.

34
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:42,123
It will be a beautiful, beautiful blog!
